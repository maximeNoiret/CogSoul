# CogSoul
Simple terminal game I'm making to practice my C++

Features a procedurally generated map, menus, customization/configuration, a little bit of lore, and a bit more to come (once I'm not too lazy to code lmao).
Will not get ported to Windows.

## How to install
### Binaries
You can download the binaries from the release section of this repo, tho it might not be up to date with the source so I recommend building it yourself. (you use linux, you should be used to compiling stuff)
### Building
I mean, you can just do like ``g++ -o CogSoul path/to/repo/*.cpp`` and it'll create an executable called Game.
Or you could load the .pro file into QTCreator and build it with that.
I dunno how all this Makefile stuff works tbh and cba to figure it out lmao just use g++


PS: if someone could make a pull request to implement A* for the enemies, I'd greatly appreciate it cuz I'm way too bad at math to figure it out.
